If prev is exclusively after next than next wont change
        no new line, no intersect, on same line
            next sc = next.sc - (prev.ec - prev.sc) - prev.text.length // (same for next ec)

       when does stuff chagne:
            TODO prev is before next
            theres new lines on prior lines
                - next.*l += # of new lines in prev
            theres new line on same line as next
                - next.*l += prev.*l + # of new lines
                - next.*c = next.*c - # of chars after lastNL on same line
            replacing on same line alters columns
            TODO adjust for deletion of preceeding stuff to include newlines
            TODO conflicting ranges, might be diff for insert/remove/combinations etc

       when is prev considered "after" next:
            when prev start line is after next end line
            if prev start line same as next end line:
                if prev sc > next ec

            issue is prev start column, and next end column. when is next ec inclusive, and when is it exclusive
