If prev is exclusively after next than next wont change
        no new line, no intersect, on same line
            next sc = next.sc - (prev.ec - prev.sc) - prev.text.length // (same for next ec)

       when does stuff chagne:
            TODO prev is before next
            theres new lines on prior lines
                - next.*l += # of new lines in prev
            theres new line on same line as next
                - next.*l += prev.*l + # of new lines
                - next.*c = next.*c - # of chars after lastNL on same line
            replacing on same line alters columns
            TODO adjust for deletion of preceeding stuff to include newlines
            TODO conflicting ranges, might be diff for insert/remove/combinations etc

       when is prev considered "after" next:
            when prev start line is after next end line
            if prev start line same as next end line:
                if prev sc > next ec

            issue is prev start column, and next end column. when is next ec inclusive, and when is it exclusive
            when prev starts after next end on same line:
            if next is a simple insert, then next.ec is illegal and cannot be prev.sc
            if next is not simple insert and instead a replace, next.ec can be used as prev.sc





new lines:
    abcdef

    prev:
    ins \n @ 4
    sc 4
    ec 4
    sl 1
    el 1

    next:
    ins x @ 7       ->      ins x
    sc 7                    sc 4
    ec 7                    ec 4    *c = next.*c - # of characters after last new line on same line as next
    sl 1                    sl 2    *l = prev.*l + # of new lines
    el 1                    el 2

conflicting ranges:
    abc\ndef\nghi
    abc
    def
    hgi


    prev:
    ins xyz (replace cde)
    sc 3
    ec 3

    el 2

    prev:
    ins mno (replace efg)
    sc 2
    ec 2
    sl 2
    el 3

    expected output:
    abxyzmnohi

    (1-4] (3-6]
    Consider 3 is already covere



when prev starts after next end on same line:
if next is a simple insert, then next.ec is illegal and cannot be prev.sc
if next is not simple insert and instead a replace, next.ec can be used as prev.sc

        // in regards to insert after insert with \n's in prev. This only affects column # if
        // they are on the same line. then, consider how many characters after last \n
        // and before next.text. Thats how many chars to shift column #s
