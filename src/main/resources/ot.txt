Different scenarios:
    prev insertions:
        if prev has new lines:
            next.sc&ec += # of new lines in prev.text

        if prev.ec == next.sc
    prev deletions:

    prev selection changes:




# Algo
# recall selection does not include strict pastes
if !selection:
    if insertion:
        next.sl&el += # of new lines in prev.text
        if prev on same line as next:
            next.sc&ec += prev.text.length
    elif deletion:
        next.sl&el -= # of new lines in prev.text
        if prev on same line as next:
                    next.sc&ec -= prev.text.length
else
