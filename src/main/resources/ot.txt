Different scenarios:
    prev insertions:
        if prev has new lines:
            next.sc&ec += # of new lines in prev.text

        if prev.ec == next.sc
    prev deletions:
        # deletion of new line works like a range for both column and row
        # all deletions work as ranges
    prev selection changes:




# Algo
# recall selection does not include strict pastes
if !p.selection:
    if p.insertion:
        next.sl&el += # of new lines in prev.text
        if prev on same line as next:
            next.sc&ec += prev.text.length
    elif deletion:
        next.sl&el -= # of new lines in prev.text       # this may all be wrong
        if prev on same line as next:
                    next.sc&ec -= prev.text.length
else
    # notes below

















# Selection notes

If prev.ec == next.sc
    then next.*c & *l need to be updated
else
    only next.*l gets updates
